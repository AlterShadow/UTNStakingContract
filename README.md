## how to transfer ownership and withdraw tokens staked on contract

there are scripts for those purposes like transfterOwnership.ts and withdrawTon.ts

you can just open command prompt in this project root directory and run `npm start`. then you can see a list of script files in scripts folder.
you choose one of these as you want and choose mainnet. Then you will be faced with wallet selection options. you should choose mnemonic(the last option) and make sure you have mnemonic in .env file. Please reference the current env.

Then the script you chose will be run on mainnet and you can either transfer ownership or withdraw tokens.
